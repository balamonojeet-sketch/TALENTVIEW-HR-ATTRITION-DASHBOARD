# PROJECT OVERVIEW :

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations because it affects productivity, morale, and overall business performance.
To address this issue, I developed the TalentView HR Attrition Dashboard, which uses data analytics to provide clear insights into workforce composition, employee turnover, and hiring effectiveness. This dashboard helps HR leaders identify high-risk departments, understand the key reasons behind employee exits, and evaluate whether current hiring strategies are working. The goal of this project is to support data-driven decision-making for improving employee retention and optimizing recruitment processes.

Page 1: TalentView – Workforce Overview

This page provides a high-level snapshot of the organization’s workforce. We start with key KPIs such as total headcount, new hires, separations, attrition rate, and average tenure, which help leadership quickly understand workforce stability. The visuals break down employees by department, age band, gender, and ethnicity, giving insights into workforce composition and diversity. This page answers questions like who makes up our workforce, where employees are concentrated, and whether the organization is balanced demographically.

Page 2: Attrition Analysis

This page focuses on employee turnover patterns and drivers. We can track attrition rate trends by month to see whether turnover is improving or worsening over time. The department-wise separations chart highlights which teams are most impacted, while separations by reason explains why employees are leaving, such as resignation, layoffs, or termination. The Key Influencers visual uses AI to identify the top factors driving attrition, helping HR pinpoint problem areas like specific departments or conditions. This page helps leadership move from what is happening to why it is happening.

Page 3: Hiring Analysis

This page evaluates the effectiveness of hiring practices. Key metrics like average time to hire, number of applications, hires, and conversion rate show how efficient the recruitment process is. The hiring funnel visual tracks candidates from application to hiring, identifying drop-off stages. We also analyze time to hire by department and hires by source, which helps HR optimize recruitment channels and reduce hiring delays. Overall, this page answers how well we are hiring and where we can improve recruitment efficiency.

Together, these three pages provide a complete HR analytics view—from workforce composition, to attrition drivers, to hiring efficiency—enabling data-driven decisions for retention, workforce planning, and recruitment strategy.
